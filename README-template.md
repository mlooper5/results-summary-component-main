### What I learned

This section is a recap of some of my major learnings while working through this project. Below I've included some of my key learnings throughout the project.


[Trick](https://www.aleksandrhovhannisyan.com/blog/62-5-percent-font-size-trick/) for never setting pixel font sizes and making them easier to compute in your head:

```css
html {
    /* 62.5% of 16px browser font size is 10px */
    font-size: 62.5%;
  }

body {
    /* 1.8 * 10px = 18px */
    font-size: 1.8rem; }
```
At the beginning of the project it's useful to define color and text variables. CSS variables are custom properties that are defined in one place and used in multiple places throughout the stylesheet.

A powerful way to use CSS variables is to create variables based on other variables. This can be useful for keeping track of color schemes and to keep CSS rules modular.

Scoping Variables:

In CSS, the scope is what determines where a variable will work based on where it is declared. There are two kinds of scope: local and global. 

A locally scoped CSS variable will only affect the specific HTML element that it is declared in along with any children that element may contain.

Globally scoped variables are declared in the :root pseudo-class. This pseudo-class points to the root element of the document.
